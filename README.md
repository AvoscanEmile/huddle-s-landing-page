# huddle-second-landing-page
Frontend Mentor is a website where front-end developers get a design and are asked to make it into a page to practice their skills. This repository is my approach for the following design: https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/huddle-landing-page-with-alternating-feature-blocks-5ca5f5981e82137ec91a5100

If you want to see this repository live you can do it here: https://avoscanemile.github.io/huddle-second-landing-page/  

**I do not own this design. If you've any questions related to it you should clarify them in the Frontend Mentor website.**
